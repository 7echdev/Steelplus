# Steelplus

Steelplus is a Minetest Mod that introduces various blocks crafted from the default steel block. These blocks serve both decorative purposes and provide interactive elements. Additionally, the mod implements security levels based on colored access cards. Steelplus has been tested on Minetest versions 0.4.16 to 5.3.0.

This mod originated from an idea within a classroom setting, aiming to create an alternative in Minetest for implementing "treasure hunts" within sci-fi environments. As an educator, I've found Minetest to be a valuable tool, fostering greater engagement among my students with the assignments. Steelplus represents a small attempt to contribute back to the community that has provided such a rich resource.
